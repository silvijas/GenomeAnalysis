Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA molecules that can replicate independently of the bacterial chromosome because they have their own replicons. This independent replication capability is a key feature that distinguishes plasmids from the rest of the bacterial DNA.

In the context of bacterial plasmids, a replicon typically includes:
An origin of replication (ori): The specific sequence where DNA replication begins.
Associated replication initiator proteins: Proteins that recognize the ori and help to start the replication process.
Control elements: Sequences that regulate the replication process, such as promoters for the replication genes and replication termination sites.
The origins of replication on plasmids are often specific to the type of plasmid and can vary between different plasmids. By identifying these ori sequences, one can infer the presence of plasmids within a genome assembly.

PlasmidFinder contains known sequences of plasmid replicons. By comparing sequences from a genome assembly to these databases, you can identify matches that suggest which parts of the assembly may be plasmids.
